**Information :**

 ## Chosen CSS tool 
 - Tailwind.
 - This is my first time playing with CSS Frameworks, I did like SCSS more than SASS and Tailwind mainly because of how easy and fast it was, with that being said, I did go with Tailwind just because the availability of utility classes makes it easier to build complex responsive layouts freely. I did face some trobles installing Tailwind at the beginning but special thanks to [Jessica Watson](https://github.com/Enyorose), she did walk me through the process of that.
